## `values.yaml` Description

Our image is pulled from `ghcr.io/bnb-chain/greenfield`. Using other images could lead to an error.

Our `storageClassName` is `ebs-sc`, with a `volumeSize` of `500Gi`.

We get the genesis file for greenfield from the `url` stated under `genesisInit`. You have to change the `url` if a new genesis file is uploaded.

The `podSecurityContext` and the `securityContext` used help to prevent any internal file system modifications as it prevent root user permissions.

At the very end, there is an option to `enableConfigMapInit`, this config refers to the `configPath` in the [repo where the genesis document is provided](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnbchain-gitops/tree/main/apps/gnfd-validator-qa). Change the `configPath` if necessary.

## Common Operations
